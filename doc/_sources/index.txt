Module Development API Documentation
===========================================

Modules are the component that extends the weevely core executing dinamically code on the target.

Modules contain certain vectors objects, containing the payload that is dynamically sent and executed to the target machine in order to extend the weevely core for a variety of post exploitation tasks.

Modules can call other modules, like you do in the weevely terminal. The modules cohesion provides a layer to interact with the target operating system, in order to administrate a web account, audit the target security, pivot deeper in the target network, and much more.

You can easily develop your own module to implement internal audit, login enumerator, sensitive data scraper, network scanner, make the modules work as a HTTP or SQL client and do a whole lot of other cool stuff.

For a quick start about the module structure of a basic module read the `Developing a new module <https://github.com/epinna/weevely-ng/wiki/developing-a-new-module>`_ wiki page.

Given below the API documentation about the Module class and the Vectors and VectorsList data structure classes.
